# Handwritten Digit Recognition with Deep Learning

This project implements a deep learning model to recognize handwritten digits using the popular MNIST dataset.
The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with Keras and TensorFlow.
It is trained on the MNIST dataset and achieves a high level of accuracy on the test set.
The project also includes functionality to test the model on custom handwritten digit images.
